Reflection on recent learning developments in Python

This first week of class, we had a refresher on OOP Concepts through a game design-related example to understand classes and objects and how they organize and represent data. It hasn't been long since I last used these concepts, but I had been having trouble understanding them well before the practical example.

Afterwards, we covered data structures and algorithms, both of which can be optimized for efficiency in terms of the resources and time used. Data structures store data in different ways that may be more efficient in the context of certain problems, just as algorithms have different computational complexities that make some better suited for solving certain problems efficiently than others. Abstract data types like lists and stacks detail operations that are implemented using different data structures. Both ADTs and how they are related to OOP are a little confusing to me. The discussion so far made me wonder if classes and/or objects can be considered data structures, but this might be a misunderstanding.

Overall, the concepts are starting to make more sense to me.
