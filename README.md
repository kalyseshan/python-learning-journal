# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

**About Me**

I'm a recent grad with a B.S. in Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior and a love for neurogenetics and neuropsychiatry. While I have almost zero prior experience with programming and Python is my first language, I'm excited to step out of my comfort zone and try something new. I'd eventually like to get involved in bioinformatics and computational neuroscience, or more specifically, learn the basics for analyzing neuroimaging and omics datasets.

**Goals for this Course**

During this course, I aim to:

1. Grow familiar with programming in general and using GitHub.
2. Become confident in my understanding of Python.
3. Apply my learning through a neuroscience-based project.

**My First Python Program**

```
print("Hello, World!")
```
